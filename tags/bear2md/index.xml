      <description>Journey of finding ideal note-taking app  TL;DR: If you want to transfer your bear notes to markdown goto Move your bear notes, if you want to emulate Bear multi-tagging check Multitagging support.
 Once upon a time I was using Bear.app for writing and organizing notes. It had really good features like multi-tagging and couple of other nice features like pseudo markdown support. Unfortunatelly a lot of things were bugged, developers slow in fixing them so I decided to move my notes from Bear to other platform.</description>
